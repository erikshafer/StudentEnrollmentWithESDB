# Student Enrollment Console App

Inspired by Nick Chapsas' video about [getting started with Event Sourcing in .NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_o-xuuVtmw). This take however uses [EventStoreDB (ESDB)](https://www.eventstore.com/).

Only the bare bones as of this commit. Will update to include some event sourcing best practices without "getting into the weeds" too much.

A video will be posted on my [YouTube channel (@event-sourcing)](https://www.youtube.com/@event-sourcing) soon.
